<b>2.	Assign Privileges: </b>
aAfter clicking the Edit button, a page comes up containing a list of available privileges. This is where you will assign required privileges to the workspace created.<br>
The box on the right-hand side((labeled RIGHT BOX)) <b>Available privileges</b> contains the privileges available in the system, while the box on the left-hand side(labeled LEFT BOX) labelled <b>Assigned privileges</b> is where the privileges selected will be moved to.<br>
For the available privileges to come up select a category and application associated to the workspace you created. It is good to note that the options to come up for Application dropdown depends on the option you select in Category.<br>

The arrows in the middle of the two boxes are for moving the roles from the available box to the assigned box and vice versa. The first two arrows are for moving the role one after the other, while the last two arrows move all the roles at once.

> A category must be selected for privileges to come up.
