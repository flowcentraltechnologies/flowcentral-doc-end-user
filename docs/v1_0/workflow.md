# Workflow
The workflow application allows your organization to automate processes in the system.  A workflow is the sequence of steps a process takes from start to finish. Apart from helping to reduce labor costs, the workflow automation application improves accuracy within a particular workflow, while keeping the record of these actions in its applets.  Human error can be significantly reduced due to the limited number of actions a user can take in implementing a workflow.<br><br>
To implement a workflow, you will need to use a trigger event that, once satisfied, causes a particular set of actions to be performed across your applications. Workflow automation can be applied to processes in various organizational departments such as sales, finance, human resources (HR), and information technology (IT). For example, you can create a workflow to streamline the user approval process. When a new user form is submitted for approval, it triggers a user approval workflow.<br>

## Workflow Item
Workflow item is an applet that houses the record of the actions performed in workflow. As a workflow is triggered, the information about where the item is coming from, the next step of action in the workflow process, the date, the user that forwarded the item, its priority on a scale of importance, error codes, and error messages is displayed by the workflow item.<br>

## Workflows
## Exception Workflow
Exceptions refer to unusual or unexpected situations that deviate from the normal flow of operations and require special attention or action to resolve. <br>
The exception workflow applet is an applet specially designed to manage and streamline the handling of exceptions within the workflow. 
These exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as errors, discrepancies, delays, or deviations from predefined rules.
