# User Group
<p id="userGroup">
A user group is a collection of users that perform similar tasks or share common characteristics in the organization. User groups make it easier to grant unique capabilities to individuals with similar access requirements, reducing the need for specifying permission for each user. Users in a particular group can access the shared records and perform any required operations on the records.<br>
Users can belong to multiple groups. For example, by creating a group with all the employees in a specific department, administrators can define privileges for the whole department in one place.<br>
