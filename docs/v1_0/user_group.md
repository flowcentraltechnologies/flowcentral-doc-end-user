# User Group
<p id="userGroup">
A user group is a group of users that perform similar tasks in the organization. User groups help to reduce the stress of having to assign unique privileges to users with similar access requirements. Users in a particular group can access the shared records and perform any required operations on the records. Users can belong to multiple groups. For example, by creating a group with all the employees in a specific department, administrators can define privileges for the whole department in one place.
