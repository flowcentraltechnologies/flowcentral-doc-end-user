# Notification
Notifications are messages sent to alert a user when an event occurs.
Short Mail Service (SMS), email, and system notifications can be configured and sent when a new form is submitted, when existing form data is deleted or modified, or by triggering custom actions from reports. When a notification script is triggered, custom notifications are sent to a phone number, an email address, or a particular system. 

## Notification channel
Everyone can be informed and updated about the recent data entering or leaving the system using the system itself, email, or SMS.

### System notification
System notifications alert users in the system without any particular request from the user. They can be configured by selecting when to send them, setting criteria to be met, and selecting users that the notifications will be sent to. 
### Email notification
Email notifications can be used to alert users when a new user account is added or when thereâ€™s an activity in a form. For example, you can trigger an email notification when a new record has been successfully added to the database.
### SMS notification
SMS notifications allow you to configure and send customized text messages to the administrators or users every time they submit a new form or when an existing form is modified or deleted.
