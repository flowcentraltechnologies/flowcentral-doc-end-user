# Report
A business report is a document that presents information, analysis, and insights related to a specific aspect of the system. It typically includes the summary of the information contained in an application or applet which is often structured in a formal way.
The purpose of this report is to provide relevant information that aids decision-making within the organization. They can be used for internal reviews, to communicate with stakeholders, or for strategic planning. <br>
The system provides fully customizable reports in applications with flexible options such as different layouts and formats, scheduling the generation of a report, and distributing reports to the intended users, including non-FlowCentral users, through e-mail. <br>
Manual report processing usually has low accuracy, poor security, and a heavy workload. The report application eases this process such that the organization can automatically generate a report from data quickly, accurately, and without stress.
