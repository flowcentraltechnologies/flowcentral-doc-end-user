# Dashboard

The dashboard is a data visualization tool in the system that provides a graphical representation of the organization’s information, data and key performance indicators. It serves as a visual representation for the organization to monitor progress and trends, and it changes with the system’s data.

    </p>
  </div>

    </ul>
